## Presentation

This is the base repository for your flutter applications.

## Create your app

When you create your flutter app, flutter will create a sub directory for your app.

You will have to copy/paste the content of this directory in the root of your repository.

In VS Code, the project will be created with all the system folders:

- android
- ios
- linux
- macos
- web
- windows

Remove the folders you don't need.
